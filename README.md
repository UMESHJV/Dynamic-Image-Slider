## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

No build tools or installations needed—it's a pure frontend project.

### 🖼️ Image Sources

All images are pulled from [https://picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos), which provides random placeholder images. Here's what each image ID displays:

| Slide | Image URL                        | Description |
|-------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| 1     | `/id/1015/900/500`              | Forest lake |
| 2     | `/id/1016/900/500`              | Mountains   |
| 3     | `/id/1018/900/500`              | Scenic view |
| 4     | `/id/1020/900/500`              | Waterfall   |
